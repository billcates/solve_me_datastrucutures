Design:
  @Create a class Block with calc_hash method
  @In the init method assign timestamp using datetime module
  Class Blockchain
    >Initialize the bloack chain class with a head and tail pointer
    >In the append method
      *If head is None,create new node and make it as head and tail
      *else,create a new node and set it as the tail
    >In the traverse method
      *If the head is None,return None
      *else,assign a head to a temporary variable and traverse all the nodes
Time and Space Complexity
        Linkedlist
        =>Append takes place at a constant amount of time,as it just updates The
          tail pointer.O(1)
        =>Traverse takes place depends on the number of nodes in the Block
          O(n)
        =>Space depends on the number of nodes plus the pointer variables head
          and tail
