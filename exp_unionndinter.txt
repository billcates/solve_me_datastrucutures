Design:
  Union
    #Initially check whether both the list contains elements,if any one is
      empty,return the other list
    #create an set,which would store the values of both the linked
      lists which are unique
    #create an linkedlist with the set values and return the
      new linked list
  Intersection:
    #Initially check whether both the list contains elements and if no num_elements
      are present in any of the list return None
    #create an list,which would store the common values of both the linked
      lists
    #create an linkedlist with the list values and return the
      new linked list
Complexity:
        *In both the functions ,the given two lists are traversed(n+n)
        (number of nodes in 1 st+number of nodes in 2nd)
        *A new linked list is also created in both functions ,which also depends
        on the previous present nodes,therefore the sum of all the 3 would give
        the result  O(n1+n2+l)
        *It takes O(n) blocks for union and intersection list and O(1) for the head
        and O(1) for tail.
