Design:
 Used dequeue module for providing the priority.
 When the class is iniated a queue element and a dictionary is also initiated
 and the num_elements is set to 1. Set the value if the key is not present in the cache.
 If the cache is at capacity remove the oldest item.As we are using dequeue
 use popleft.It returns the value of the key using get and returns -1 when
 value is not present.

 Time complexity:
    all the operations such as get and set takes a constant time ,as it is lookup
    in a dictionary O(1)

Space Complexity:
  A dictionary with the capacity is used and the queue of the capacity is also
  used.therefore O(capacity)
