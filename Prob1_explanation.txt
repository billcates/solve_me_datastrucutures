Design:
 “Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.
 An LRU cache is a type of cache in which we remove the least recently used
 entry when the cache memory reaches its limit.” Here, Cache entries in a
 dictionary and a deque module from the Python collections are used for storage
 and to track the Cache history.

 Time complexity:
    all the operations such as get and set takes a constant time ,as it is lookup
    in a dictionary O(1)

Space Complexity:
  A dictionary with the capacity is used and the queue of the capacity is also
  used.therefore O(capacity)
